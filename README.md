# Welcome, This Is Who I Am:


Hi there! My name is **Noah** (or **NoNo** for short), and I'm a 15-year-old developer with a passion for creating immersive gaming experiences. I specialize in developing mods for the popular online multiplayer game, FiveM, using the LUA programming language.

I started my journey in the world of development in 2021 and have been continuously improving my skills ever since. It's amazing to see how far I've come in just a short amount of time. I was taught the basics of programming by an experienced developer, but I quickly surpassed their abilities and started developing mods that were even better than theirs!

My goal as a FiveM developer is to bring new and exciting features to the game that enhance player interaction and overall gameplay. I love coming up with new ideas and bringing them to life through code. Whether it's creating custom weapons, vehicles, or game modes, I'm always pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy helping my family and spending time with friends. I have a strong desire to continue learning and improving, and I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.

`If you're a fan of FiveM, I hope you'll check out my mods and see the creativity and hard work I put into every project. Thank you for stopping by and taking the time to read a little bit about me. I'm excited to see where this journey will take me and I can't wait to see what amazing projects I'll create next!`
